This project has been created to provide a utility library to help developers solve asynchronous issues in a clean and standard fashion.  This library aims to provide an easy to use API to reduce boilerplate code for common asynchronous situations in ActionScript and Flex, and provide building blocks for more complex solutions to make very painful situations easier.  Common situations will be handling Component Lifecycle and Web services calls smoothly without race conditions.
